| # | Model / Topic                  | Description                                                                 | Notes                               |
|---|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| ● | Linear & Polynomial Regression | Implemented matrix operations, dataset generators, Cross Validation learning and the least squares classifier from scratch. Also implented a pipeline that can be called as a method to any Regression problem. | See [folder](Regression) for full code & examples |
| ● | MultiLayer Perceptron Classifier | Implemented a multi-layer perceptron from scratch in Java, including forward/backward propagation, gradient descent training, configurable architectures, activation functions, dataset generators. | See [folder](MutliLayerPerceptronClassifier) for full code and execution examples |
| ● | K-Means Clustering | Implemented K-Means clustering from scratch in Java, including random centroid initialization, Euclidean distance assignment, centroid updates, convergence check, CSV I/O, and clustering error computation. | See [folder](K-Means%20Clustering) for full code and execution examples |
