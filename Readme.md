| # | Model / Topic                  | Description                                                                 | Notes                               |
|---|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | Linear & Polynomial Regression | Implemented matrix operations, dataset generators, Cross Validation learning and the least squares classifier from scratch. Also implented a pipeline that can be called as a method to any Regression problem. | See the folder for full code & examples |
| 2 | MultiLayer Perceptron Classifier | Implemented a multi-layer perceptron from scratch in Java, including forward/backward propagation, gradient descent training, configurable architectures, activation functions, dataset generators. | See folder for full code and execution examples |
| 3 | K-Means Clustering | Implemented K-Means clustering from scratch in Java, including random centroid initialization, Euclidean distance assignment, centroid updates, convergence check, CSV I/O, and clustering error computation. | See folder for full code and execution examples - TODO: Add readme and the report |
